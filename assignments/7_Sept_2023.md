# First Aider Codging Assignment

- `git clone` `git@github.com:janoside/btc-rpc-explorer.git`
> * Note: that this repository does not use React or other modern UI coding framework. We're going to challenge Aider/GPT-x to rewrite the code using a modern framework and using the underlying Blockchain.com APIs
- Make sure you have `git pull upstream master` on your local copies of the class repository (`git@github.com:jeffrey-l-turner/CPSC-370_BTC_derivates_AI_Chapman.git`)
- Ask Aider per the strategies reviewed in the lecture to "rewrite" the code base using React and the Blockchain.com api for service. Your experience may vary from mine since you do not have access to GPT-4 keys.
- Your task will be judged from your Aider interaction submissions. These are the `.aider*` files in your repo.
- The assignment submission will be to use Aider with both git commits as well as the `.aider` `.md` file logs. These will be due by end of day on the 12th of September.
- Please share any insights or new strategies you find in the Discord channel "assignments".
