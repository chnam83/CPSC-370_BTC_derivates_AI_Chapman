- Immutable Services (payments, smart contracts, oracle maintenance)
- Continuous Integration
- Project Standards (coding conventions, ecosystems used, code commit/maintenance process)
- Framework: Agile software development approach & tickets ([we're using GitHub]()https://github.com/jeffrey-l-turner/CPSC-370_BTC_derivates_AI_Chapman/issues/new)
- AI assistance (new approach) -- going to try: `formal specification`, `type/schema specification`, `code generation`, `unit testing`
